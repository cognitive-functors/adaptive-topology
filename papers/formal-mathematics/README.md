# Formal Mathematics / Формальная математика

This directory contains 6 research papers (each in Russian and English) on the formal mathematical foundations of the C4 framework: Agda proofs, functors, categorical semantics, linear logic, and type systems.

## Papers

| # | File (RU / EN) | Topic |
|---|----------------|-------|
| 1 | `functors.md` / `functors-en.md` | Basic functors of the category **Lin** -- differential linear logic with dependent types, MALL connectives, and (co)inductive types |
| 2 | `functors-catalog.md` / `functors-catalog-en.md` | Systematic catalog of functors in the category **Belief** -- cognitive states and transformations in C4 coordinate system (Z3^3 = 27 states) |
| 3 | `monoidal-category.md` / `monoidal-category-en.md` | Monoidal category **Lin**: differential linear logic with dependent types, foundational structure |
| 4 | `MILL.md` / `MILL-en.md` | Semantics of Multiplicative Intuitionistic Linear Logic (MILL) in the context of distributed processes with true concurrency |
| 5 | `par-explanation.md` / `par-explanation-en.md` | Duality, linear implication, and multiplicative disjunction (par) -- core concepts of linear logic |
| 6 | `type-system.md` / `type-system-en.md` | Type system: MALL with dependent types, (co)inductive types, and differentiation |

## How These Relate to C4

These papers provide the category-theoretic and type-theoretic foundations for the C4 cognitive coordinate system. The functor catalog (paper 2) directly maps the 27 cognitive states of Z3^3 to categorical structures. The remaining papers formalize the logical and algebraic infrastructure underlying the framework.

## Language

Each paper is available in Russian (original) and English (translation). Files without a `-en` suffix are in Russian; files with `-en` are in English.
