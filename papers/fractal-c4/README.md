## Recommended Reading Order

1. **Paper 1** (Fractal) -- The core fractal refinement hypothesis.
2. **Paper 4** (Formalism) -- Mathematical foundations for recursive structure.
3. **Papers 2, 3, 5, 6** -- Domain-specific applications, in any order.

## Key Idea

The fractal conjecture states that any basis state (T, D, A) can itself be decomposed into a 3x3x3 sub-cube of finer-grained states, applying the same T/D/A axes recursively. This yields arbitrary precision (27, 729, 19683, ...) while maintaining the algebraic structure at every level.
