# C4 Papers Collection

Research papers organized by topic. All papers build on or extend the C4 (Complete Cognitive Coordinate System) framework, which models cognitive space as Z3^3 = 27 basis states along three axes: Time, Scale, and Agency.

These papers explore the core theory, applications, extensions, and cross-domain connections of the C4 framework.

## Categories

### 1. Fractal C4 (6 papers, bilingual EN+RU)
**Directory:** [fractal-c4/](fractal-c4/)

Recursive self-similar structure of C4. The fractal refinement conjecture: each of the 27 states decomposes into 27 sub-states at finer granularity. Covers knowledge representation, system modeling, formalism, content analysis, and language.

### 2. Algorithmic Topology (5 papers, EN only)
**Directory:** [algorithmic-topology/](algorithmic-topology/)

Connection between C4's navigational algebra and combinatorial optimization. The MASTm (Multi-scale Adaptive Spectral TSP meta-solver) framework for instance-adaptive TSP solving. Includes the adaptive routing theorem and cross-domain empirical evidence.

### 3. Formal Mathematics (6 papers, bilingual EN+RU)
**Directory:** [formal-mathematics/](formal-mathematics/)

Category-theoretic foundations: functors catalog, monoidal category structure, linear logic (MILL) interpretation, par-explanation, and type system formalization.
