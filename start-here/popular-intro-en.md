# C4: A Map of How We Think

## What is C4?

**Authors: Ilya Selyutin, Nikolai Kovalev**

C4 stands for the Complete Cognitive Coordinate System. It is a framework
that describes human thinking using just three simple dimensions, producing
27 distinct cognitive states.

Think of it as a GPS for the mind. Instead of latitude, longitude, and
altitude, C4 uses three axes that capture where your attention is directed
at any given moment.

## The Three Axes

### Time -- When are you focused?

Every thought has a temporal orientation:

- **Past** -- remembering, analyzing what happened, drawing on experience.
- **Present** -- perceiving what is here and now, reacting, being in the moment.
- **Future** -- planning, imagining, anticipating what comes next.

### Scale -- How zoomed in or out are you?

Your thinking operates at different levels of detail:

- **Concrete** -- specific facts, sensory details, particular examples.
- **Abstract** -- general patterns, categories, principles, theories.
- **Meta** -- thinking about thinking itself, reflecting on your own reasoning process.

### Agency -- Whose perspective are you taking?

Every thought involves a viewpoint:

- **Self** -- your own experience, feelings, goals, and actions.
- **Other** -- another person's perspective, empathy, social awareness.
- **System** -- the bigger picture, institutions, culture, rules of the game.

## How the 27 States Work

Each axis has three values. Combine one value from each axis and you get
a cognitive state. Three axes times three values each gives 3 x 3 x 3 = 27
possible states.

For example:

| State | Time | Scale | Agency | What it feels like |
|-------|------|-------|--------|--------------------|
| (Past, Concrete, Self) | Past | Concrete | Self | Remembering a specific personal experience |
| (Present, Abstract, Other) | Present | Abstract | Other | Understanding someone else's general pattern of behavior |
| (Future, Meta, System) | Future | Meta | System | Reflecting on how society's way of thinking might evolve |

These are not rigid boxes. Real thinking flows between states constantly.
C4 gives you a vocabulary to notice and describe those shifts.

## Why Does This Matter?

Understanding where your attention sits at any moment has practical value:

**Self-awareness.** When you feel stuck, you can ask: what state am I in?
Often the answer is that you have been circling through the same two or three
states. Deliberately shifting to an unused axis can break the loop.

**Communication.** Misunderstandings often happen because two people are
operating in different cognitive states. One person is talking about concrete
past experience while the other is thinking about abstract future plans.
Naming the difference helps bridge the gap.

**Problem-solving.** Complex problems usually require visiting multiple states.
A business decision might need concrete past data (what happened before),
abstract present analysis (what patterns exist now), and future system-level
thinking (how will the market respond). C4 helps you check which perspectives
you have covered and which you have missed.

**Learning and teaching.** Effective learning involves deliberate movement
across states -- from concrete examples to abstract principles to
meta-level reflection on your own understanding.

## The Fractal Property

Each of the 27 states can itself be subdivided into 27 sub-states,
giving 729 finer-grained distinctions. This can continue recursively:
729 becomes 19,683, and so on. The structure is fractal -- the same
three-axis pattern repeats at every level of detail.

For most practical purposes, the 27 base states are sufficient.
The fractal property matters for researchers who need finer resolution.
