  "description": "A unified theory with 17 unique research papers (12 bilingual EN+RU, 5 EN-only) proving adaptive strategy selection outperforms fixed approaches. Formally verified in Agda (Z3-cubed, 10/11 theorems) and empirically validated via MASTm (Multi-scale Adaptive Spectral TSP meta-solver, 0.22% gap on fl3795). Central thesis: Intelligence = adaptive routing.",
