# C4 Hypercube Visualizations

Authors: Ilya Selyutin, Nikolai Kovalev

## Contents

This folder contains interactive 3D visualizations of the C4 27-state
cognitive coordinate system (Z3^3).

### Files

- **hypercube-en.html** -- English version of the interactive visualization.
- **hypercube-ru.html** -- Russian version of the interactive visualization.

## How to Use

Open either HTML file in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
The visualization renders the 27 cognitive states as nodes in a
three-dimensional space, with axes corresponding to Time (Past/Present/Future),
Scale (Concrete/Abstract/Meta), and Agency (Self/Other/System).

You can rotate, zoom, and click on individual nodes to explore the
state space and the connections between states.

No server or installation is required -- the files are fully self-contained.
