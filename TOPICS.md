## Connections to Established Fields

- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Cognitive distortions mapped as C4 state patterns
- **Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP):** Metaprograms, neurological levels, Sleight of Mouth as C4 coordinates and transformations
- **TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving):** Inventive principles mapped to C4 state transitions
- **Systems Thinking:** Senge's archetypes, Meadows' leverage points in C4 framework
- **Category Theory:** Heuristic categorical framing (functors, monoidal structure); explicitly acknowledged as motivational, not rigorous
- **Linear Logic (MILL):** Resource-sensitive reasoning about cognitive state management
- **Type Theory:** Dependent types encoding cognitive constraints in Agda
- **Group Theory:** Z3^3 structure with proven group axioms
- **Metric Spaces:** Hamming distance with proven triangle inequality
- **Temporal Logic:** LTL/CTL for reasoning about cognitive trajectories
- **Phenomenology:** Structure of subjective experience through (T, D, A) coordinates
- **Epistemology:** Classification of knowledge types by cognitive position
- **Bateson's Levels of Learning:** Mapped to D-axis (Scale) progression
- **Wilber's Integral Theory:** Four quadrants mapped to A-axis and D-axis combinations
- **Halliday's Systemic Functional Linguistics:** Ideational metafunction levels correspond to D-axis
- **Quantum Mechanics:** Entanglement as metaphor for correlated cognitive states (analogy, not formal)
- **Epigenetics:** Regulatory patterns as analogy for meta-cognitive state influence
- **Energy Landscapes:** Cognitive states as attractors in a potential landscape
- **Network Science:** Diffusion and connectivity on the 27-state graph
- **Combinatorial Optimization:** MASTm meta-solver for TSP; fingerprint-based adaptive routing
- **Neuroscience:** Multiplexed subspace routing in neural populations
- **Biological Evolution:** Adaptive immune system as fingerprint-route-adapt instance
- **Economics/Game Theory:** Market microstructure as adaptive strategy selection
- **Ecology:** Niche partitioning as environmental fingerprint-based strategy routing

## Connections: C4 <-> MASTm

- **Fingerprint <-> Coordinates:** cv_nn_dist maps to heterogeneity, spectral_gap to decomposability, modularity to clustering; (T,D,A) maps to time/scale/agency axes -- same abstract protocol
- **Router <-> Orchestrator:** Strategy selection based on structural analysis of input
- **Attention Budget <-> Time Budget:** Resource allocation adapted by fingerprint
- **Cognitive Trajectory <-> Optimization Trajectory:** State sequences with attractors and perturbations
- **Reframing <-> Double Bridge:** Escape from local optima via structural perturbation
- **Universal Principle:** Both C4 and MASTm instantiate: fingerprint(input) -> route(strategy) -> adapt(execute)
