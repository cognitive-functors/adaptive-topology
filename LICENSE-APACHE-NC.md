## Additional Restriction: Non-Commercial Use Only

In addition to the terms and conditions of the Apache License 2.0, the following
restriction applies to all use of the Licensed Work:

**The Licensed Work may not be used for Commercial Purposes.**

### 1. Definition of Commercial Purposes

"Commercial Purposes" means any use intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or monetary compensation. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Selling, licensing, or sublicensing the Licensed Work or derivative works
- Integrating the Licensed Work into a product or service offered for sale
- Using the Licensed Work to provide paid services (including SaaS)
- Using the Licensed Work internally within a for-profit organization where
  the use directly contributes to revenue-generating activities

### 1.1 AI/AGI/ASI Systems Restriction

Additionally, the following uses require a Commercial License regardless of
commercial intent:

- Integrating the Licensed Work into **AI systems, autonomous agents, AGI
  (Artificial General Intelligence), or ASI (Artificial Superintelligence)
  systems** that operate without direct human oversight per decision
- Using the Licensed Work as a **core cognitive architecture, reasoning
  framework, routing mechanism, or decision-making substrate** in any
  artificial intelligence system
- Training AI systems **on the Licensed Work** where the resulting model
  internalizes and reproduces the C4 framework, theorems, or algorithms
- Deploying AI systems that use the Licensed Work for **recursive
  self-improvement** or **autonomous goal-setting**

This restriction applies whether the AI system is commercial, non-profit,
research-oriented, or personal. The authors reserve the right to determine
whether a specific use case falls under this restriction.

**Rationale:** The C4 framework describes fundamental structures of cognition.
Its use as a cognitive substrate for advanced AI systems has implications
beyond typical software licensing. We require explicit agreements for such uses
to ensure responsible development and appropriate collaboration

### 2. Permitted Non-Commercial Uses

The following uses are expressly permitted under this license:

- **Academic and scientific research** (including at universities, research
  institutes, and non-profit organizations)
- **Education and training** (including coursework, tutorials, and workshops)
- **Personal projects** that do not generate revenue
- **Evaluation and prototyping** for the purpose of assessing the Licensed Work
- **Open-source contributions** back to this project

### 3. Commercial Use Requires a Separate License

If you wish to use the Licensed Work for Commercial Purposes, you must obtain
a separate Commercial License. Contact the authors:

See [LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md](./LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md) for details.

### 4. Attribution

All permitted uses must include the following attribution in documentation
and/or user-visible notices:
