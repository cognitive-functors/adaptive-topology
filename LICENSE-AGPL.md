## Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that,
in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community.
It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the
modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public
use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public
access to the source code of the modified version.

## Key Terms

### 0. Definitions

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.

"You" refers to any individual or entity exercising permissions granted by
this License.

"Modification" refers to any work that is based on the Program, or any work
that contains all or a portion of the Program.

### 1. Source Code

You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty.

### 2. Basic Permissions

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright
on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the
unmodified Program.

### 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under WIPO copyright treaty.

### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish
on each copy an appropriate copyright notice.

### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce
it from the Program, under the terms of Section 4, provided that you also
meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and
   giving a relevant date.

b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under
   this License. This requirement modifies the requirement in Section 4 to
   "keep intact all notices."

c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
   anyone who comes into possession of a copy.

d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate
   Legal Notices.

### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
Sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source.

### 7. Remote Network Interaction

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting
with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such
interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your
version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server
at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating
copying of software.

**This is the key distinction of AGPL-3.0 from GPL-3.0:** if you run a
modified version of this software as a network service (SaaS, API, web
application, etc.), you must make the complete source code of your modified
version available to all users of that service.

### 8. Termination

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided
under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void,
and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

### 9. No Surrender of Others' Freedom

If conditions are imposed on you that contradict the conditions of this
License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.

### 10. Disclaimer of Warranty

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW. THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

### 11. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE
PROGRAM, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO
USE THE PROGRAM.
