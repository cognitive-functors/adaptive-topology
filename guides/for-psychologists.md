# C4 for Psychologists

A practitioner's guide to using the Complete Cognitive Coordinate System (C4) in clinical and therapeutic contexts.

---

## What Is C4?

C4 models cognitive states as points in a discrete 3D space Z3^3 (27 states) defined by three axes:

- **T (Time):** Past (0) / Present (1) / Future (2)
- **D (Scale):** Concrete (0) / Abstract (1) / Meta (2)
- **A (Agency):** Self (0) / Other (1) / System (2)

Every thought, belief, or mental state can be located at coordinates (T, D, A). Therapeutic change corresponds to movement through this space.

## CBT Cognitive Distortions as C4 Coordinates

C4 provides a geometric interpretation of Beck's cognitive distortions:

| Distortion | C4 Coordinate | Structural Explanation |
|------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Catastrophizing | (Future, Abstract, Self) = (2,1,0) | Projection into future + abstraction from specifics + self-focus |
| Rumination | (Past, Concrete, Self) = (0,0,0) | Stuck at concrete past self-events |
| Overgeneralization | D-axis jump: Concrete -> Abstract | Single event inflated to universal rule |
| Mind Reading | (Present, Abstract, Other) = (1,1,1) | Abstracting about another's mental state |
| Personalization | A-axis collapse: System -> Self | Systemic event attributed to self |
| All-or-Nothing | D-axis extremes: Concrete <-> Abstract | No intermediate scale representation |
| Emotional Reasoning | (Present, Concrete, Self) = (1,0,0) | Treating immediate feeling as evidence |
| Fortune Telling | (Future, Abstract, Self) = (2,1,0) | Similar to catastrophizing; prediction without evidence |
| Labeling | D-axis: Concrete -> Abstract, A fixed | Replacing specific behavior with abstract identity label |
| Should Statements | (Future, Abstract, System) = (2,1,2) | Imposing systemic rules on future behavior |

**Key insight:** Most distortions involve being *stuck* at a fixed coordinate or making *uncontrolled jumps* along one axis. Therapy = learning controlled navigation.

## Therapy Trajectories as C4 Paths

### Example: Treating Catastrophizing

Patient presents with catastrophizing about job loss.

**Initial state:** (Future, Abstract, Self) = (2,1,0)
"I will lose my job and everything will fall apart."

**Therapeutic path (CBT-style):**

1. **Ground in present:** T-shift: Future -> Present = (1,1,0)
 "What is actually happening right now at work?"

2. **Concretize:** D-shift: Abstract -> Concrete = (1,0,0)
 "Name one specific thing that happened today."

3. **Perspective-take:** A-shift: Self -> Other = (1,0,1)
 "How would your colleague describe the same situation?"

4. **Systemic view:** A-shift: Other -> System = (1,0,2)
 "What broader organizational factors are at play?"

5. **Reframe abstractly:** D-shift: Concrete -> Abstract = (1,1,2)
 "What pattern do you see across similar situations?"

**Total path:** (2,1,0) -> (1,1,0) -> (1,0,0) -> (1,0,1) -> (1,0,2) -> (1,1,2)
Each step is a single-axis operator application. This is **Theorem 9** in action: shortest path between any two states is constructively computable.

### Example: Treating Rumination

**Initial state:** (Past, Concrete, Self) = (0,0,0)
"I keep replaying that conversation where I said the wrong thing."

**Therapeutic path:**

1. **Meta-awareness:** D-shift: Concrete -> Meta = (0,2,0)
 "Notice that you are *replaying* -- what is the pattern here?"

2. **Present-focus:** T-shift: Past -> Present = (1,2,0)
 "What are you feeling right now as you notice the replaying?"

3. **Ground concretely:** D-shift: Meta -> Concrete = (1,0,0)
 "Feel your feet on the floor. What do you hear?"

## Connection to NLP Metaprograms

NLP metaprograms map naturally onto C4 axes:

| NLP Metaprogram | C4 Axis | Mapping |
|-----------------|---------|---------|
| Toward / Away From | T-axis | Future-oriented (toward) vs. past-avoidant (away) |
| Internal / External reference | A-axis | Self (internal) vs. Other/System (external) |
| Global / Detail | D-axis | Abstract (global) vs. Concrete (detail) |
| Proactive / Reactive | T + A interaction | Future+Self (proactive) vs. Past+Other (reactive) |
| Self / Other sort | A-axis | Direct mapping to Agency dimension |
| Match / Mismatch | D-axis operations | Same-level (match) vs. cross-level (mismatch) |

**Implication:** Eliciting a client's metaprogram profile is equivalent to identifying their habitual C4 region. Metaprogram change = learning to access underused coordinates.

## Neurological Levels (Dilts) and the D-Axis

Robert Dilts' Neurological Levels align with the D (Scale) axis:

| Dilts Level | D-value | Interpretation |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Environment, Behavior | Concrete (0) | Observable, specific actions and contexts |
| Capability, Beliefs/Values | Abstract (1) | Generalized rules, principles, patterns |
| Identity, Spirituality | Meta (2) | Self-referential models, purpose, meaning |

Therapeutic interventions at different Dilts levels correspond to D-axis targeting. A mismatch between intervention level and problem level (e.g., behavioral technique for identity-level issue) is visible as a D-axis coordinate mismatch.

## Clinical Applications

### Assessment
- Map client's presenting concerns to C4 coordinates
- Identify habitual region (where client "lives" cognitively)
- Identify avoided regions (coordinates client never visits)

### Treatment Planning
- Define target coordinates for therapeutic outcomes
- Plan trajectory: sequence of single-axis moves
- Use Theorem 9 (shortest path) to minimize unnecessary steps

### Progress Tracking
- Track client's C4 coordinate distribution over sessions
- Quantify "cognitive flexibility" as the number of distinct states accessed
- Measure therapeutic progress as movement toward target coordinates

## Limitations

- C4 is a coarse-grained model (27 states). Real cognition is continuous and multi-layered.
- Coordinate assignment depends on clinical judgment; inter-rater reliability needs empirical study.
- The framework is descriptive (where someone is) not prescriptive (where they should be).
- Formal validation with clinical populations is ongoing.
