# C4 Guides

Audience-specific introductions to the Complete Cognitive Coordinate System (C4 / Z3^3).

Each guide presents C4 through the lens of a particular discipline, mapping C4's formal structure to domain-specific concepts and methods.

## Recommended Reading Order

1. Start with the guide matching your background.
2. Read **integration-guide.md** if you plan to build systems using C4.
3. Read **for-agda-users.md** if you want to understand or contribute to the formal proofs.

For the full mathematical treatment, see `papers/c4-deep-dive-en.md`.
